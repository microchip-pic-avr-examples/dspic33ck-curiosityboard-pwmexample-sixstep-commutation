# PWM Peripheral Example: 
# Six-Step Commutation PWM Switching Schemes for BLDC Motor using dsPIC33CK Curiosity Board

## 1. INTRODUCTION
This document describes implementation of three popular PWM switching schemes used for the Six-step commutation of BLDC motor. The examples are implemented on the dsPIC33CK curiosity development board and demonstrates the Override and Swap features of the High Resolution PWM module in the dsPIC33CK Digital Signal Controllers.

### 1.1 PWM Switching Scheme 1 
In this PWM scheme, only two switches are active at any given time. Of the two active phases, one high side and one low side switch is controlled with its phase’s corresponding PWM waveform, as shown below.

Since only one switch needs to be driven at a time on a given phase, independent PWM Output mode is used. The output override feature is used to turn off the other switches. A three-phase scheme is implemented using PWM Generator 1 (PG1) configured as Host and the other two PWM Generators
(PG2 and PG3) configured as Client. PG1 is self-triggered, whereas PG2 and PG3 are triggered from PG1’s Start-of-Cycle (SOC). Enabling PG1 will start the system in a synchronized fashion.

Configuration Summary:
- Independent Edge PWM mode
- Independent Output mode
- Master Period and Duty Cycle Used
- Override State is drive low

### 1.2 PWM Switching Scheme 2
In this PWM scheme, three switches are used to control the two active phases. In a given sector, one active phase is driven with a complementary PWM waveform and the other active phase has only its low side driven high at 100% duty cycle, as shown in figure below. Like Scheme 1, overrides are used to control the outputs in each sector.

In this scheme, Complementary Output mode is used and overridden as needed in each sector. The same three-phase Host-Client synchronization technique is used as in Scheme 1. 

Configuration Summary:
- Independent Edge PWM mode
- Complementary Output mode
- Master Period and Duty Cycle Used
- Override State is Dependent on Sector State
- Dead time is applied to the Complementary PWM Signal

### 1.3 PWM Switching Scheme 3
In this PWM scheme, four switches are driven in a given sector. Two pairs of complementary PWM outputs are applied to the two active phases. The inactive phase is overriden to low as needed, as shown below.

  <p align="left" >
  <img  src="images/pwm3.png"></p>

In this scheme, Center-Aligned PWM mode is used with dead time to prevent high current during switching transitions. The two active phases are driven 180 degrees out of phase to one another using the SWAP feature.

Configuration Summary:
- Center-Aligned PWM mode
- Complementary Output mode
- Master Period and Duty Cycle Used
- Override State is Dependent on Sector State
- Dead time is applied to the Complementary PWM Signal

## 3. HARDWARE SETUP
<p style='text-align: justify;'>This section describes hardware setup required for the demonstration.</p>

1. The board has an onboard programmer **'PICkit™ On Board (PKoBv4)'**, which can be used for programming or debugging the dsPIC33CK256MP508. To use the on-board programmer, connect a micro-USB cable between Host PC and Micro USB **connector J7** provided on the dsPIC33CK Curiosity Development Board. </p>

    <p align="left" >
